    <h2>growing techinique of browler chicken</h2>
    <p>To grow broiler chickens, provide a clean, draft-free, heated brooder house with proper bedding, adequate space, and fresh food and water. Feed starter mash for the first few weeks, then switch to grower pellets as they mature. Maintain appropriate temperature and ventilation levels, increase space and feeder access as they grow, and implement biosecurity measures to prevent disease.  </p>
