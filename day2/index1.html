    <h2>history of html</h2>
    <p>HTML, or<b>HyperText Markup Language</b> , was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 at CERN to facilitate the sharing of research documents. Its first public version, HTML 1.0, appeared in 1993, followed by standardized versions like HTML 2.0 (1995) and HTML 4.01 (1999), which brought features like tables, frames, and multimedia support. The introduction of XHTML in 2000 aimed to align HTML with XML's stricter rules, while HTML5, officially recommended in 2014, simplified the language, introduced new multimedia capabilities, and is now the standard for modern web development. </p>

    <p>We must first examine the idea of hypertext in order to comprehend the origins of HTML. Early 20th-century pioneers like Vannevar Bush proposed the concept of tying information together through hypertext, envisioning a <span style="color:red;">"memex"</span> machine that could organize enormous volumes of information using linked microfilm.</p>
