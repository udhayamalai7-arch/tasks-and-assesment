Ms Amudha said the TVK announced that Mr Vijay would address the cadres by noon on Saturday whereas he came only in the night. A large number of people had gathered since morning and many became tired and dehydrated by the time Mr Vijay arrived. The venue of the event - Velusamypuram - was finalised on the request of the organisers, she said.

Playing videos on large screens on how the tragedy unfolded, she said a lot of youth drove along with Mr Vijay’s vehicle to the venue which resulted in the number of people expected at the rally going up by more than a double.</p>
