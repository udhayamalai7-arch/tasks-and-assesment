            <h2>growing methods of browler chicken</h2>
            <p>Broiler chicken growing methods focus on controlled environments, proper nutrition, and meticulous health management within intensive, semi-intensive, or free-range farming systems. Key aspects include selecting healthy chicks, providing high-protein feed in distinct starter, grower, and finisher stages, maintaining a clean and dry environment with constant access to fresh water, and implementing biosecurity measures, temperature control, and ventilation in the housing. The most common method is the deep litter system, though battery cages are also used for efficient, large-scale production.  </p>
            <h2>technique of growing browler chicken</h2>
            <p>Poultry meat is an important source of high quality proteins, minerals and vitamins to balance the human diet. Specially developed breeds of chicken meat (broiler) are now available with the ability of quick growth and high feed conversion efficiency. Depending on the farm size, broiler farming can be a main source of family income or can provide subsidiary income and gainful employment to farmers throughout the year. Poultry manure has high fertilizer value and can be used for increasing yield of all crops..</p>

        <p>India has made considerable progress in broiler production in the last two decades. High quality chicks, equipments, vaccines and medicines are available. Technically and professionally competent guidance is available to the farmers. The management practices have improved and disease and mortality incidences are much reduced. Many institutions are providing training to entrepreneurs. The broiler population has increased from 4 million in 1971 to 700 million in 1998. An average annual growth rate of 20% was estimated during the eighth five year plan (1992-1997). Increasing assistance from the Central/ State governments and poultry corporations is being given to create infrastructure facilities so that new entrepreneurs take up this business. Broiler farming has been given considerable importance in the national policy and has a good scope for further development in the years to come.</p>
